Create a  super cute mascot which can be act as a character which can be shown in the app. The character can be happy, sad, annoyed, ecsatsic based on the app state and based on how many tasks the user has completed. Create a persona which runs inside the app thereby giving the user a fantatsic companaion in managing their habits


The app looks fine. Lets add a feature - 
1) User should be select a theme from the theme picker.
2) Whatever we have now is the default theme. Add other themes - Dark mode, zen theme, neon theme, retro theme and minimalist. 
3) We as devs should have the ability to add new themes later.

Create a theming engine of sorts which can dynamically add themes and change the appearance just by selecting an option. 
Allow the user to go to settings section where they can get a theme configurator where they can choose the theme.
